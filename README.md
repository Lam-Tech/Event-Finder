### Overview
Event Finder is an application that helps people connect together even during this special period. In this fast-paced life, we need to keep changing our environment as we're moving toward, so we need to adapt to the new environment as fast as we can, such as making new friends, finding your buddy that has the same habit as do. Hence, we've built the Event Finder application. This is a Meteor application that we made for the Meteor Hackathon 2021. The main purpose we create this event finder is to help people to connect to each other, at the same time, they can also try out different events to discover new things in their life.

#### Benefits
In Event Finder, user will be able to create and join different event. Each event have specific information for user, such as event title, time, date, location, information about the event, initiator name, tag, online or offline, number of people have, and number of people need. With this information, user can decide which event they want to go, and just simply click join button to go to the event.
